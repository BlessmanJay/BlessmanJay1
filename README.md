# Hello there!
I'm a Junior Frontend Web Developer with a strong passion for problem-solving, logical thinking, and building efficient, scalable solutions.

My goals are to become a professional full stack developer, gain real-world experience working in teams and following coding best practices, build portfolio projects that employers love to see, network with developers from around the world, build my confidence  and sharpen my skills, as  well as contribute to open source.

I recently completed a Professional Foundations Program with ALX, thereby launching my career in Tech.
